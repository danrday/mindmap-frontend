edit node tab:

clicking 'save as new category' takes the current custom attributes and saves
those as a new category. 
currently, if another category was selected,
it does not apply those values to the new category... just the set custom attrs.

technique of only transferring checked edited items
to prevent from other items that were
experimented with but then disabled. this step
can discard that data and only select the wanted
changes. plucks those only and overwrites those.

other things like changing a max range on a slider
will update that atribute's max range (rangeMax and rangeMin
are saved in a flat structure along with the other global
properties) these rules apply at the app level,
not the node level. a max range value for node radius
is updated in the globalSettings page and doesn't
need to be checked to save an updated value.
so, someone could possibly increase the radius max range value
and then deselet the radius on a node and it would still update.
you don't have to go into global settings to edit this.
but... it should also be available on the globel edit
screen.
